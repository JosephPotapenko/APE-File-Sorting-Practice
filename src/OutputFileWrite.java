/*
 * Write the code for the stubbed out writeToOutputFile below.
 * 
 * For this problem, we won't worry about what the data passed in looks like,
 * we'll just write it.
 * 
 * To perform operations in this method, you will need to utilize the OutputFile
 * class from the open output file exercise on this exam.  A correctly working 
 * OutputFile.class file is included as part of the Eclipse project and also
 * exists in the same directory as this source file.  This means you have direct access to 
 * the features of that class (fields and methods).  You do not have to import the class to use it.
 * 
 * First, check the OutputFile class and see if a file is already open (by accessing the isOpen field).
 * If a file is not open, assign the following string to the errorMsg field of OutputFile:
 * 
 * attempt to write to file that is not open
 * 
 * If the file is open, write the data using the PrintStream field (outputFile) in the OutputFile
 * class.  The data should be written to the file and followed by a SINGLE newline (carriage return).
 * Use the appropriate method to ensure the data is written properly.
